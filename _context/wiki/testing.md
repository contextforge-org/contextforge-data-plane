# Testing

## Verification Rings

- **Workspace checks** — code compiles and unit behavior holds.
- **In-repo integration tests** — MCP routing against mock backends.
- **`cf-integration` harness** — full control-plane publication and external-dataplane request path end to end.
- **Load and benchmark** — see [Performance](performance.md).

## Workspace Validation

CI runs these on every change; run them locally before pushing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --locked --workspace --all-features
cargo shear --check-test-targets --deny-warnings --locked
```

Use `cargo test` when nextest is unavailable. For wiki changes, also run `mdbook build _context/wiki` and `mdbook test _context/wiki`.

`with_tools` is for testing only. It provides unauthenticated token, JWKS, and
user-config helpers for local fixtures. The all-features unit test commands
include it. Production builds and conformance images omit it and must not use
`--all-features`. The harness owns conformance authentication and Redis setup.
`/contextforge-rs/health` is available without
this feature. See [Deployment](deployment.md#production-builds) for production
build commands and [Getting Started](getting-started.md#local-cargo-dev-workflow)
for local testing.

New protocol-sensitive tests target MCP `2026-07-28`, connect through
`server/discover`, and send the required per-request client metadata. A small
`compatibility` module retains the active `2025-11-25`/`initialize` cases until
that production compatibility surface is removed in a dedicated change; do not
add new behavior to that lane. Every case must remain request-independent, with
no required `Mcp-Session-Id`, session affinity, or retained backend transport.
SSE remains outside the external-dataplane contract.

## In-Repo Integration Tests

`crates/contextforge-data-plane-lib/tests/gateway.rs` is the single library
integration target. It exercises the public gateway API against in-process MCP
backends without recompiling a shared support tree for every feature file.

| Area | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `gateway/{tools,prompts,resources,subscriptions}.rs` | Active routed operations and exact routing failures. |
| `gateway/plugins.rs` | Gateway-owned CPEX ordering, mutation, denial, progress, and prompt seams using deterministic recording plugins. Resource coverage includes direct and aliased URIs, text/blob conversion, canonical pre-hook URIs, published-target rewrites, rejection of unpublished targets, metadata preservation, and pre/post denial. Concrete plugin behavior stays in each plugin crate. |
| `gateway/harness/` | Authentication, modern and compatibility clients, in-memory configuration, concrete mock backends, and owned server fixtures. |
| `gateway/future_contracts/` | Deferred fanout, pagination, TLS, completions, subscriptions, and cancellation contracts. |

`TestServer` binds `127.0.0.1:0` before spawning, uses cooperative
cancellation, and has a `Drop` fallback. `GatewayFixture` owns the gateway and
all backend servers. Tests should request the minimum topology: one virtual host
and one backend by default, with extra backends declared explicitly by the case.

The workspace currently keeps 13 ignored tests: 11 library future contracts
and two real-process Redis/binary E2E tests. Ignored tests are not dead tests:
keep them compiling, keep their intended assertions, give each a concrete
blocker reason, and list them with:

```bash
cargo nextest list --locked --workspace --all-features --run-ignored only
```

The two binary E2E tests and `tests/conformance/` remain separate infrastructure
boundaries. Active in-process tests run with no Docker or Redis dependency. Resource policy coverage belongs in this active harness, not in ignored binary tests or new legacy-client cases. Runtime unit tests verify that enabling or disabling hooks during a resource read preserves its original policy decision.

Parameter-header integration tests verify that calls without a published tool
schema skip local `Mcp-Param-*` validation and still reach the backend. Unit and
integration coverage also includes missing, malformed, unexpected, repeated,
and mismatched recognized headers; Base64 encoding; nested paths; numerically
equivalent integers; and invalid annotation names, types, duplicates, and
non-`properties` paths.

## MCP Conformance

[`cf-integration`](https://crates.io/crates/cf-integration)
owns the official fixture, control-plane registration, Compose topology, server
and client runners, result rendering, and transactional baseline handling. This
repository keeps only the CI invocation, Make targets, and expected findings.

Comment exactly `/conformance` on a pull request to run the **Conformance**
Actions workflow. Only repository owners, members, and collaborators can start
it. The workflow acknowledges the command, tests the pull request head commit,
and reports the final result back to the pull request. CI builds and names the
conformance binary artifact using that same head SHA and retains it for 90 days,
so changes to `main` do not invalidate the artifact. It runs the modern client
and modern server eras through the external dataplane in standalone mode. This
starts Redis, the dataplane, nginx, and the official fixture without the control
plane. The harness discovers the fixture's tools, resources, templates, and
prompts and publishes their routes and actual tool schemas directly to Redis
as named MessagePack maps. Its own auth service signs test JWTs and serves
loopback JWKS; the production dataplane receives no signing key. Selecting that
lane also runs the fixture-direct server leg and the scoped external-dataplane
client leg:

Install the pinned harness revision from
[Getting Started](getting-started.md#cf-integration-conformance), then run
`make conformance`. CI installs that same revision; conformance and Inspector
install and run Node/npm only inside Docker images.

The Make target tests the committed data-plane `HEAD` and rejects tracked
uncommitted changes. The harness builds `CF_DATAPLANE_REF` from
`CF_DATAPLANE_REPO` using the production Dockerfile with `plugins` and without
`with_tools`. CI supplies a prebuilt production binary in its conformance image
and sets `CF_DATAPLANE_REF` empty to skip the source build. To use another local
CLI binary:

```bash
CF_INTEGRATION=/path/to/cf-integration \
  make conformance
```

Update every selected baseline atomically only after all operational work and
baseline evaluation succeeds:

```bash
make conformance-bless
```

Baselines are partitioned beneath
`tests/conformance/baselines/<client-version>/<server-era>/`. Server findings
use `fixture-direct.yml` and `external-data-plane.yml`; scoped client findings
use `client/external-data-plane.yml`. Operational failures are always failures
and cannot be blessed. Runtime checkouts, logs, results, and reports remain
beneath `.integration/`.

A strict baseline match means the observed findings have not changed; it does
not mean complete protocol coverage. Inspect the report's individual checks
before blessing changes. In particular, the external dataplane deliberately
rejects catalog list methods owned by the control plane. Scenarios that need
`tools/list` for setup cannot exercise the subsequent schema or parameter-header
checks through this lane; `NotObserved` findings record missing coverage, not
successful validation. The pinned fixture also lacks an `x-mcp-header`-annotated
tool for the custom-header server scenario. Parameter-header validation remains
covered by the active in-repo tests described above. Keep these setup gaps
distinct from observed protocol failures when interpreting conformance results.
