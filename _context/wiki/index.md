# ContextForge External Dataplane — Wiki

This wiki captures durable project context and working preferences.
Check this index at the start of a task to decide whether deeper context is needed,
then follow only the links that are relevant.

## Quick orientation

- **Repo**: `contextforge-data-plane` — the Rust ContextForge external dataplane.
- **Core invariant**: the ContextForge external dataplane is pure routing logic. No IAM, UI, or metrics storage.
- **Protocol target**: the ContextForge external dataplane supports MCP `2026-07-28` and `2025-11-25` over Streamable HTTP. Both use stateless request handling; `initialize` remains supported but does not establish external-dataplane session state. Legacy SSE paths are being removed from the external dataplane.
- **Status convention**: project, architecture, routing, and operations pages
  describe the current implementation. The page under **Upcoming** describes
  the tentative ContextForge 2.0 target and migration roadmap.
- **Architecture context**: [architecture.md](architecture.md) — read before touching the hot path. Full wiki index above.
- **Validation gate**: `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy` + `cargo nextest` + `cargo deny` must be clean; CI also runs `cargo shear`. See [preferences.md](preferences.md) for by-change-type requirements.
- **System topology**: `client → nginx → [ContextForge built-in dataplane | ContextForge external dataplane | ContextForge control plane]`; external-dataplane config flows from the control plane via `dataplane_publisher.py` → Redis → external dataplane. See [project.md § System topology](project.md#system-topology).
